# Push to New GitHub Repository

Your code is ready to be pushed to a new GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `prowebsiteco` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: Professional websites for UK tradespeople - Pro Website Co
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/home/repos/trade-site-crafted

# Add the new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prowebsiteco.git

# Push to the new repository
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Quick Copy-Paste (Update YOUR_USERNAME first!)

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prowebsiteco.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all your files there.

**Next Step**: Once the code is pushed to GitHub, proceed to connect Cloudflare Pages (see CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md)
